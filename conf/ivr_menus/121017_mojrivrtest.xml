<!—- 

 — Calls come to freeswitch and freeswitch core analyse the number and check expression and based on that it rout the call…
 - here, call is treated as IVR, so will play IVR menu.. have set answer to play properly pass media on channel 
 - have set timeout if extension does not match, call be dropped after 10 sec and max-failures/max-timeouts is just for test
 - play sounds and files based on digit pressed
->

<context name=“test_ivr_demo”>

<extension name="ivr_demo_test3”>
    <condition field="destination_number" expression=“^(8018054603)$”>
      <action application=“Answer”/>
      <action application="ivr" data="ivr-test"/>
      <action application=“Hangup”/>
    </condition>
</extension>

<context>

<include>
 <menu name=“ivr-test”
     timeout="10000"
     max-failures="3"
     max-timeouts="3">

      <entry action="menu-play-sound" digits="1" param="say: hello”/>
      <entry action="menu-sub" digits=“2” param=“ivr-test_submenu"/>                 
     <entry action=“menu-play-sound” digits=“3” param=“playback music.wav”/>

 </menu>

<menu name=“ivr-test_submenu”>
     <entry action=“menu-play-sound” param=“playback goodby.wav”/>
     <entry action=“menu-exec-app” param=“hangup”/>
</menu>
 
</include>


<!--
scenario 3: 

I am not sure this scenario 3 directly work through dialplan, might be completed with some script or any channel param or any stream related param.

if above does not work then we will have to change source code of freeswitch.

In the past I had implemented configurations for bulk calls to different queues, but I had never made similar incoming call balancing.

If there is an additional module that makes these settings I would like to know, if it is dial plan I would like to know too :)
